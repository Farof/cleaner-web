# Cleaner Web

Declutter websites

## Version

0.0.2

## What

Cleaner Web is a Firefox addon that loads userstyles on a selection of websites to clean up the visual noise and present you only the important information.

## Why

Ever felt tired of all these buttons, links and widgets everywhere ? Can't help looking at the comments under an article even though you known they are going to upset you or make you lose precious time ?

I know I do. This is an attempt at a solution. 

## Install

Download and open with Firefox: https://github.com/Farof/cleaner-web/raw/master/bin/cleaner-web.xpi

Currently only tested in Firefox Nightly (29). Should work on Firefox main release. Will actively test later.
